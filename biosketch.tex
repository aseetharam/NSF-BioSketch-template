\subsection*{(d) Synergistic Activities}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Publicly available, pipeline and scripts development (https://github.com/ISUgenomics and \\
https://github.com/aseetharam). Some examples include:
\begin{itemize}
\item common\_analyses: repository for most commonly used programs optimized to run on clusters
\item common\_scripts: repository for simple utility scripts to efficiently run or manipulate the NGS data.
\item StampedeBLAST: Optimized NCBI-BLAST program pipeline for the XSEDE (Stampede) cluster.
\item basic\_UNIX\_2015: workshop materials for the basic UNIX workshop, offered during summer, 2015 at Iowa State University.
\end{itemize}
\item Publicly available tutorials for NGS analyses (http://gif.biotech.iastate.edu/Tutorial): Actively contributed for developing a comprehensive wiki pages for performing NGS data analyses. The pages include many custom pipelines as well as custom scripts that can be readily used for specific problems.

\item Guest lecturer: in the courses related to Phylogenomics/evolutionary biology (EEOB 561X, spring 2014, ENTM595 during fall 2013) and Next Generation Sequencing (GEN 349X during spring 2014). 

\item Workshop instructor: Co-organized and instructed summer workshops on UNIX skills at Iowa State University. The audience included staff, faculty and various graduate students. This 4 hour crash course is conducted every year with 2 sessions during the summer months. I also instructed a one-day hands-on UNIX workshop (multiple times) for faculty and students of Purdue University (over 100 attendee's total). Developed teaching materials, data and slides for the interactive class session.

\item Co-instructor: Co-taught graduate level course in Bioinformatics (BIO487/587, fall 2012) program. Shared responsibility for preparing lectures, exams, homework assignments, and grading. Taught under-graduate level lab in Genetics (BIO382L, fall 2012) program. Full responsibility for lectures, exams, homework assignments, and grading.
